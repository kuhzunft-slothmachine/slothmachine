            <p>
              The Slotmachine is a project by Achim Zepezauer that is currently
              combining 225 different recordings (each one with a length of 45
              seconds) from 18 artists in a random order. You can either simply
              press START and get surprised or deactivate the AUTO PLAY - Button
              to make a selection of specific instruments.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are two ways to support the project. You can donate via
              paypal at the donate-button or you can purchase a 10â€œ vinyl copy
              of some combinations, picked by Achim. The record is available
              from February 1st, 2019 on, at Gruenrekorder or right here at
              www.kuhzunft.com/records.html, or elsewhere.
